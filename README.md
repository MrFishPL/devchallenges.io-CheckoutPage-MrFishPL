Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?<br>
  [here](https://mrfishpl.github.io/devchallenges.io-CheckoutPage-MrFishPL/)
- What was your experience?<br>
  To be honest I don't like this challenge very much. I spent a lot of hours doing this and there was a lot of small things to do. The responsiveness of the website gave me some pain but finally I did it.
- What have you learned/improved?<br>
  I've improved my form skills ofc. I've learnt a lot of styling selects and numbert inputs. The website has a javascript layer to, so I improved my js skills.
- Your wisdom? :)<br>
Making and styling forms should be considered torture ;_;
